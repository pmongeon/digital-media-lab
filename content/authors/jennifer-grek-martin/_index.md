# About me

I am fascinated by how we receive, process, and represent information – particularly geospatial information.  I am also curious about how we use social media to give meaning simultaneously to places and to ourselves. I currently teach Organization of Information, Geospatial Information Management, Research Methods, and History of the Book.

I am completing an Interdisciplinary PhD, in which I explore why and how people use fantasy film and literature to give meaning to Real World places. This project builds on previous work in Geography and Historical Cartography, where I researched the role of iconology in representations of Hungary in 17th century Dutch atlases, and in Information Management, where I researched how we visualize landscapes described in both text and film. This research led me to participate in two international film research surveys: The World Hobbit Project and the Game of Thrones Project (a.k.a. ‘Questeros’).

Prior to joining SIM, I used a geospatial strategy to organize a collection of photographs for the State Historical Society of Wisconsin and devised a library database and categorization system for an archaeological firm in Ontario.  For many years, I have also worked as a digital cartographer and illustrator.  After moving to Halifax in 2007, I taught introductory geography and cartography courses at Saint Mary’s University and Dalhousie and found that teaching allows me to blend my love for learning with my desire to share what I learn with others.
I also enjoy playing outside, all things Tolkien, and international folkdance.
