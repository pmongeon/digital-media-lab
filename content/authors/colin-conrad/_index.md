# About me

Colin is an Assistant Professor in the School of Information Management. Colin is an information technology researcher who employs cognitive neuroscience and neuroimaging to answer questions about information technology use experience and behaviour. His research often employs techniques from neuroscience and computer science, where he is cross-appointed. His current work concerns mind wandering, attention, online collaboration tools, online communities, education technology, and data science. When not doing research, he is either outside or doing something geeky involving video games or music that sounds like the 1980s.
